Given three points, this python script:
  1. Plots the triangle
  2. Calculates the Fermat Point
  3. Plots the Fermat Point

## What is the Fermat Point?
The Fermat Point is the geometric median of a triangle. In other words, the point which minimizes the non-squared distance from the three points of the triangle.
